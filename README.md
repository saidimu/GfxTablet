What is GfxTablet?
==================

GfxTablet shall make it possible to use your Android device (especially
tablets) like a graphics tablet.

It consists of two components:

* the GfxTablet Android app
* the input driver for your PC

The GfxTablet app sends motion and touch events via UDP to a specified host
on port 40118.

The input driver must be installed on your PC. It creates a virtual "network tablet"
on your PC that is controlled by your Android device.

So, you can use your Android tablet or smartphone to control the PC and,
for instance _use GIMP with your Android tablet as a graphics tablet_
(even pressure-sensitive, if your hardware supports it).

Features
--------

* Pressure sensitivity supported
* Size of canvas will be detected and sent to the client
* Option for ignoring events that are not triggered by a stylus pen:
  so you can lay your hand on the tablet and draw with the pen.


Requirements
------------

* App: Any device with Android 4.0+ and touch screen
* Driver: Linux with uinput kernel module (included in modern versions of Fedora, Ubuntu etc.)

If you use Xorg (you probably do):

* Xorg-evdev module loaded and configured
  Probably on by default, but if it doesn't work, you may need to activate the
  module: see https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/issues/7#issuecomment-13338216


Installation
============

Github repository: http://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet


Part 1: uinput driver
---------------------

On your PC, either download one of these binaries (don't forget to `chmod a+x` it):

* [uinput-networktablet 64-bit, dynamically linked, tested with Fedora 18 and Ubuntu 12.10](https://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet/blob/binaries/uinput-networktablet-x86_64?raw=true)

or compile it yourself (don't be afraid, it's only one file)

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone git://github.com/rfc2822/GfxTablet.git`
2. Install gcc, make and linux kernel header includes (`kernel-headers` on Fedora)
3. `cd driver-uinput; make`

Then, run the binary. The driver runs in user-mode, so it doesn't need any special privileges.
However, it needs access to `/dev/uinput`. If your distribution doesn't create a group for
uinput access, you'll need to do it yourself or just run the driver as root:

`sudo ./networktablet`

Then, `xinput list` should show a "Network Tablet" device.

You can start and stop (Ctrl+C) the Network Tablet at any time, but please be aware that applications
which use the device may be confused by that and could crash.

`networktablet` will display a dot for every touch/motion event it receives.


Part 2: App
-----------

You can either compile the app from the source code in the Git repository or download
it directly from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.gfxtablet

After installing, enter your host IP in the Settings / Host name and it should be ready.


Part 3: Use it
--------------

Now you can use your tablet as an input device in every Linux application (including X.org
applications). For instance, when networktablet is running, GIMP should have a "Network Tablet"
entry in "Edit / Input Devices". Set its mode to "Screen" and it's ready to use.

It's important that you start the app *after* the driver, because it sends the resolution
to the driver. If you start the app before the driver, the mouse cursor will always be on
the left top and won't move much.
